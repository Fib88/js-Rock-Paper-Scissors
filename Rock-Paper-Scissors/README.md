# js-games

Here's my first draft for the rock-paper-scissors game.

I started with a simple html page without css and added working game logic with js. 
Initially I wanted to use a switch but abandoned that because it skips a few steps. I'll add the switch in when I'm
sure I have a working game ready.

Currently the only output is to console so I'm working on getting it on the html page.

To be continued

Update:

The game logic works and now I'm working on styling the page.
I had some troubles using flex-box and opted to use a table to place my content where I want it to.

Update 2: 

Added more styling to make it look like a pok√©mon game. I also included additional logic for the reset button and score counter.
What I still want to include now is to have HP counters that count down and the first one to run out of HP loses.
I also plan to included game rules in the README.
To be updated. I'm having trouble publishing the page to github because the html index file is in a folder. Trying to figure out if I can publish
this way.
