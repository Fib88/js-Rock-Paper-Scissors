# js-games

Here's my first draft for the rock-paper-scissors game.

I started with a simple html page without css and added working game logic with js. 
Initially I wanted to use a switch but abandoned that because it skips a few steps. I'll add the switch in when I'm
sure I have a working game ready.

Currently the only output is to console so I'm working on getting it on the html page.

To be continued
