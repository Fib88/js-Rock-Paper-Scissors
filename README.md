# Here's my first draft for the rock-paper-scissors game.

I started with a simple html page without css and added working game logic with js. 
Initially I wanted to use a switch but abandoned that because it skips a few steps. I'll add the switch in when I'm
sure I have a working game ready.

Currently the only output is to console so I'm working on getting it on the html page.

To be continued

 ## Update:

The game logic works and now I'm working on styling the page.
I had some troubles using flex-box and opted to use a table to place my content where I want it to.

 ## Update 2: 

Added more styling to make it look like a pokémon game. I also included additional logic for the reset button and score counter.
What I still want to include now is to have HP counters that count down and the first one to run out of HP loses.
I also plan to included game rules in the README.
To be updated. I'm having trouble publishing the page to github because the html index file is in a folder. Trying to figure out if I can publish
this way.

 ## Update 3: 
Lost a lot of time trying to publish using absolute paths for the images. Apparently you need relative paths to publish images on git, resulting in quite some confusion on my end.
As I had put all my images in a seperate folder I couldn't reach them. I changed the location of the folders and will ask a colleague on monday.

 ## Update 4:
 Found out I forgot to push my updated file paths to github. Nothing to be seen here move along.
